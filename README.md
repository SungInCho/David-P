### [Project Result](doc/EDA_ 911_Calls.pdf)

+ This project is conducted by Sung In Cho (sc4393)

+ Project summary: This is an exploratory analysis for data collected from 911 calls in Montgomery County. Members of rescue team always risk many people’s lives while they are working. Their work requires great deal of concentration for a very long time, as one little mistake can result in death. Hence, sufficient time for rest and relaxation is extremely important. However, a certain number of rescue workers on call are always necessary because it is impossible to know what kind of accident would happen in the future. We thought, if we can predict and forecast a general number of accidents in the future, it would be easier to allocate proper number of rescue workers at the right time. Which may also lead to a proper amount of rest time for them. The source of the 911.csv data is “http://montcoalert.org/”. This page provides information of 911 calls in Montgomery County. Montgomery County is located in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The data are collected from Dec 10, 2015 to Oct 25, 2016.
